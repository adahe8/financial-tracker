# Practice Financial Tracker: Learn the MERN

This is a financial tracker website built using MongoDB for database storage, and the Express, React, and NodeJS packages - technologies that I was brand new to initially. The "Create Purchase" page is used to log purchases that I make, and the "View Purchase" page displays cards of the purchases that I have logged, making it easier for me to track my spending. 

## Under Development:
Currently, I'm working on adding a delete button to the View Purchases section to allow users to remove older purchases or accidental repeats. It'd be helpful to have edit functionality too, so I will add that next.

## To use:
Fork this repository into VSCode, and rename the .env.example file to .env. Once you have done this, choose a number to set the PORT variable equal to in .env - this is the port the website will run on. Common port numbers used are 3000, 5000, 8000. If you have another page running on a certain port number, do not reuse it - pick anew one.
